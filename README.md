# Image Cryptography Based on Rubix's Cube Principle

Implementation of image encryption and decryption using Rubix's Cube Principle. This algorithm is based on 
the paper which can be found at https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jece/2012/173931/

## Aim
Flask based web application which encrypts an Image and provides required key values to Decrypt the Image.

### Sample Image

## Encrpyted Image
